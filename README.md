 

## üöÄ Deployment Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- MongoDB Atlas account (or local MongoDB)
- Render account

### Backend Deployment (Render Web Service)

1. **Create Render Web Service**
   ```bash
   # Connect your GitHub repository (backend folder)
   # Build command: npm install
   # Start command: npm start
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/securesight
   PORT=10000
   NODE_ENV=production
   CORS_ORIGIN=https://your-frontend-app.onrender.com
   ```

3. **Database Setup**
   ```bash
   # Seed script will run automatically on first deployment
   # Or manually trigger: npm run seed
   ```

### Frontend Deployment (Render Static Site)

1. **Create Render Static Site**
   ```bash
   # Connect your GitHub repository (frontend folder)
   # Build command: npm install && npm run build
   # Publish directory: dist
   ```

2. **Environment Variables**
   ```bash
   VITE_API_URL=https://your-backend-app.onrender.com
   ```

### Local Development

1. **Clone Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/securesight-dashboard.git
   cd securesight-dashboard
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd backend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env
   # Update MONGODB_URI in .env
   npm run seed  # Populate database
   npm run dev   # Start development server
   ```

3. **Frontend Setup**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cp .env.example .env.local
   # Update VITE_API_URL in .env.local
   npm run dev   # Start Vite dev server
   ```

## üì° API Endpoints

### GET /api/incidents
```bash
# Get all incidents (newest first)
curl https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api/incidents

# Get unresolved incidents only
curl https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api/incidents?resolved=false
```

### PATCH /api/incidents/:id/resolve
```bash
# Resolve an incident
curl -X PATCH https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api/incidents/123/resolve
```

### GET /api/cameras
```bash
# Get all cameras
curl https://your-backend-app.onrender.com/api/cameras
```

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **React + Vite** - Lightning-fast development with HMR and optimized production builds
- **Component-Based Design** - Modular, reusable UI components
- **React Query** - Intelligent caching, background updates, and optimistic U

### Backend Architecture
- **Express.js** - Minimal, flexible web framework for Node.js
- **MongoDB + Mongoose** - Document-based storage perfect for flexible incident data
- **RESTful API Design** - Standard HTTP methods and intuitive resource endpoints
- **Environment-based Config** - Secure credential management across environments

### Database Choice: MongoDB
- **Document Flexibility** - Easy to extend incident types and properties
- **Horizontal Scaling** - Ready for multi-tenant deployments
- **Rich Queries** - Complex filtering and aggregation capabilities
- **Atlas Integration** - Managed hosting with built-in security

### Build Tool: Vite
- **Fast Development** - Sub-second HMR and instant server start
- **Optimized Builds** - Tree-shaking, code splitting, and asset optimization
- **Modern Defaults** - ES modules, TypeScript, and CSS preprocessors out-of-the-box

## üîÆ If I Had More Time...

### Performance Optimizations
- [ ] **WebSocket Integration** - Real-time incident notifications with Socket.io
- [ ] **MongoDB Indexing** - Optimize queries with compound indexes on timestamps and camera
- [ ] **Redis Caching** - Cache frequently accessed incidents and camera data
- [ ] **CDN Integration** - Serve thumbnails and static assets via CloudFront
- [ ] **Image Optimization** - WebP conversion and lazy loading for thumbnails

### Enhanced Features
- [ ] **Advanced Filtering** - Date range picker, multi-camera selection, incident type filters
- [ ] **Incident Analytics Dashboard** - Charts showing incident trends and camera hotspots
- [ ] **User Authentication** - JWT-based auth with role-based permissions (Admin/Operator/Viewer)
- [ ] **Export Functionality** - PDF incident reports and CSV data export
- [ ] **Push Notifications** - Browser notifications for critical incidents
- [ ] **Bulk Operations** - Mark multiple incidents as resolved simultaneously

### Security & Monitoring
- [ ] **Rate Limiting** - Express rate limiter to prevent API abuse
- [ ] **Input Validation** - Joi/Zod schemas for request validation
- [ ] **Audit Logging** - MongoDB collection tracking all user actions
- [ ] **Health Checks** - `/health` endpoint for uptime monitoring
- [ ] **Error Tracking** - Sentry integration for production error monitoring
- [ ] **API Versioning** - Structured versioning strategy for backward compatibility

### 3D Visualization (Extra Credit)
- [ ] **Three.js Floor Plan** - Interactive 3D facility layout with camera positions
- [ ] **Incident Heatmaps** - 3D visualization of incident density by location and time
- [ ] **Virtual Camera Network** - 3D representation of camera coverage areas
